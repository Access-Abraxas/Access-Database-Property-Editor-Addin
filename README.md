# The Microsoft Access Database Property Editor Add-In
This 100% Free Microsoft Access Add-In tool was designed to help view and edit MS Access database level properties for any database you have open in MS Access.  The database level properties are the DAO properties found in the `Application.CurrentDB.Properties` collection.  These properties are generally the database level settings used within the Microsoft Access client for your specific Access database application.  Changing these properties manually **CAN BE DANGEROUS** and difficult to do, and this tool is an attempt to make it safer to edit these properties, as well as make it super simple to quickly view all the database properties for any given Access database application.
